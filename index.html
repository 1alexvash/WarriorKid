        CHAPTER 1: THE WORST YEAR
      </div>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Tomorrow is the last day of school, and I CAN’T WAIT FOR IT TO BE OVER!!
        This has been the worst year EVER! The bad part is that I don’t see how
        next year is going to be any better at all. Fifth grade was horrible—I’m
        afraid sixth grade will be EVEN WORSE. Why was it so bad? Where do I
        begin?

      <p class="paragraph">
        Top five reasons why fifth grade was HORRIBLE: <br />
        <br />1.  It’s school! I’m sitting at a desk ALL DAY. <br />
        2.  I learned that I’m dumb! That’s right. All the other grades I
        thought I was “smart.” But this year was a FAILURE! I still don’t know
        my times tables! How the heck am I going to make it through next year?
